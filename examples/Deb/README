This directory contains multi-objective optimization problems from 
Deb et al. (2002).

Each example can be used with the SGAP, MOOP, and NSGA2P algorithms.  For
example, to run the NSGA2P on the FON problem, you would type

  >> fon(@nsga2p, 100, 30, .7, .01)

where 100 = population size, 30 = number of generations, .7 = probability
of crossover, .01 = mutation rate.  When running MOOP, the .7 would be the
frontier-selection-bias parameter PHI.  

We might get better results with MOOP by also specifying its (optional) crossover 
probability, but a truly fair comparison of any algorithm against NSGA-II should
allow the specification of only two parameters.
